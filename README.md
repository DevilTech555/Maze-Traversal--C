# Maze-Traversal--C

Program and necessary test files to:
* Accept user input for rows/columns size of displayed maze
* Accept ASCII text file to use as a test case for maze with 0s being open paths and 1s being walls
* Traverse through maze recursively with an array size limit of 200x200
* Display size generated in previous step and whether or not a solution was found
* If the maze finds an exit returns "Solution found!" 
* If the maze exits through the same entrance returns "No solution!"

#### Version
0.2.0

### How to Use
* Run program and enter the desired output size by rows/columns
* Enter the ASCII text file that contains the maze generated by 0s and 1s
* Program displays maze output with traversed paths and whether a solution was found
* To generate random mazes to traverse simply change the defined M and N values in fieldgenerator.c and the desired filename output in the writeFile() function

### Known Glitches
* Sometimes extremely large files (up to 200x200) might return a "No solution" with an entrance of [0][0]
* Extensive testing has been done to large text file sizes (up to max size) and the following issue has been found:
*If the user inputs either the maze dimensions or filename to navigate too quickly unstable results occur.*
*To correctly process larger files it may be necessary to slow input down to correctly process input*
* If incorrect row/column sizes are entered corresponding to different row/column sizes in the file results may be unstable
* Non-existing filenames will cause segfault
